	<h1>OpenIdAjaxTextBox specification</h1>
	<h2>Requirements</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>User supplied text value preserved across postbacks</li>
		<li>Successful authentication results, if any, preserved across postbacks both in 
			the user agent and server contexts.</li>
		<li>Asserting Provider&#39;s logo, where available, should appear in the place of the 
			OpenID logo when successful assertion is provided.</li>
		<li>Identity assertion should be verified by the RP web server during the first 
			postback of that web page where a positive assertion is available.</li>
		<li>Visual indication of when discovery and authentication are taking place.</li>
		<li>Authentication to be attempted in asynchronous immediate mode with each 
			Provider authorized by the claimed identifier until an authentication is 
			achieved if possible.</li>
		<li>If no OpenID endpoint will assert the user&#39;s identity in immediate mode, assist 
			the user in &quot;setup&quot; mode authentication with the preferred Provider using a 
			popup window.</li>
		<li>In a single page visit, all user supplied identifiers entered into the box 
			resulting in discovery will have the discovery results saved in temporary memory&nbsp; 
			at the user agent, and will be reused rather than performing rediscovery if the 
			user re-enters a previously entered identifier.</li>
		<li>In a single page visit, if the user enters multiple user supplied identifiers 
			that on discovery resolve to the same claimed identifier, any authentication 
			attempt made on that claimed identifier will be used for the other user supplied 
			identifiers that resolve to the same claimed identifier.&nbsp; For example, if 
			the user types &quot;blog.nerdbank.net&quot; and authenticates to it, then changes the 
			value to &quot;<a href="http://blog.nerdbank.net">http://blog.nerdbank.net</a>&quot; then 
			when discovery reveals this as the same identifier, the successful 
			authentication from &quot;blog.nerdbank.net&quot; will be applied to the new identifier 
			implicitly.</li>
	</ol>
	<h2>Non-requirements</h2>
	<ol>
		<li>Multiple authentication attempt logs preserved across postbacks</li>
		<li></li>
	</ol>

	<h2>Design considerations</h2>
	<p>A throttle should be placed to limit how many immediate requests are made to 
		Providers simultaneously, to avoid XRDS files with many Providers causing the 
		login control to initiate so many connections that the browser slows down.</p>
