/// This page is a required as part of the service discovery phase of the openid protocol (step 1).
/// 
/// How does a url like http://www.myserver.com/user/bob map to  http://www.myserver.com/user.aspx?username=bob ?
/// Check out gobal.asax and the URLRewriter class. Essentially there's a little framework that allows for URLRewrting using the HttpContext.Current.RewritePath method.
/// 
/// A url such as http://www.myserver.com/user/bob which is entered on  the consumer side will cause this page to be invoked.
/// This page must be parsed by the openid compatible consumer and the url of the openid server is extracted from href in:  rel="openid.server" href="?".
/// It is the responsibility of the consumer to redirect the user to this url.
/// 
/// The XRDS (or Yadis) content is also rendered to provide the consumer with an alternative discovery mechanism. The Yadis protocol allows the consumer 
/// to provide the user with a more flexible range of authentication mechanisms (which ever has been defined in xrds.aspx). See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yadis.
